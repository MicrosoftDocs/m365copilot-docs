# Continue streamed conversations with Microsoft 365 Copilot using the Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat API

[!INCLUDE [beta-disclaimer](../../includes/beta-disclaimer.md)]

The Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat API allows you to create and continue multi-turn conversations with Microsoft 365 Copilot, while respecting the defined access controls within the organization. Use the Chat API to continue streamed conversations with Microsoft 365 Copilot.

This documentation covers continuing streamed Copilot conversations using the Chat API. Learn how to create [Copilot conversations](copilotroot-conversations.md) or continue [synchronous conversations](copilotroot-conversationschat.md) with the Chat API.

## Permissions

      "text": "You asked for a summary of the document **<File>Business-Model.docx</File>**. Here\u2019s a concise overview based on its content:\n\n---\n\n## **Summary: What Is a Business Model?**\n\n### **Definition & Importance**\n- A **business model** is a holistic framework for creating, delivering, and capturing value. It\u2019s not just about how a company makes money, but how it creates value for customers, partners, and itself over the long term.\n- Business models are essential for startups and established companies alike, as they help unlock sustainable value and guide experimentation in the marketplace.\n\n### **Key Distinctions**\n- **Not a Business Plan:** A business model is different from a business plan. While a business plan is a static document with projections and assumptions, a business model is dynamic and focused on real-world experimentation.\n- **Not Just Revenue Strategy:** Monetization is only one part of a business model. Other components include operations, customer acquisition, retention, supply chain, and more.\n\n### **Design & Experimentation**\n- Business model design is about building a sustainable value chain, starting with a clear value proposition and focusing on a specific niche before scaling.\n- Experimentation is crucial\u2014entrepreneurs must test and iterate on their models to find what works in the real world.\n\n### **Innovation**\n- **Technological vs. Business Model Innovation:** While technology can enable new business models, true innovation often comes from rethinking how value is created and delivered, not just from new tech.\n- **Competitive Moats:** Business model innovation can create lasting competitive advantages, especially in the digital era where network effects and platform models are prevalent.\n\n### **Components of a Business Model**\n- **Business Model Canvas:** A popular framework that includes key partners, activities, value proposition, customer relationships, segments, resources, channels, cost structure, and revenue streams.\n- **Lean Startup Canvas:** Focuses on experimentation, customer feedback, and iterative design, especially for startups.\n\n### **FourWeekMBA Perspective**\n- Emphasizes simplicity, noise reduction, branding, distribution, and profitability.\n- Divides business model components into \u201cpeople\u201d (brand, value proposition, positioning) and \u201cfinancial\u201d (customer segments, channels, profit formula) dimensions.\n\n### **Types of Business Models**\nThe document details **30+ business model types**, including:\n- **Hidden Revenue (Asymmetric):** Monetizing user data (e.g., Company1, Company2)\n- **One-for-One:** Social impact with each sale (e.g., TOMS Shoes)\n- **Razor and Blade:** Selling a core product cheaply, accessories at a premium (e.g., Company3)\n- **Peer-to-Peer:** Platforms connecting users directly (e.g., Company4)\n- **Multi-Sided Platforms:** Serving multiple customer groups (e.g., Company5)\n- **Freemium, Subscription, Affiliate, Consulting, Agency, Vertically Integrated, E-commerce Marketplace, Discount, Attention Merchant, Privacy-focused, Franchise, On-Demand, User-Generated Content, Educational, Chain/Franchise Mix, Instant News, Blockchain-based, Multi-brand, Family-owned, Humanist Enterprise, Direct-to-Consumer, Enterprise Sales, Distribution-based**, and more.\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n- There\u2019s no single \u201cbest\u201d business model\u2014success depends on context, timing, and market conditions.\n- Business models must evolve as markets and technologies change.\n- Experimentation, clear value propositions, and understanding both people and financial dimensions are critical for building a sustainable business.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a deeper dive into any specific business model type or framework mentioned in the document?",

It's not just about how a company makes money, but how it creates value for customers, partners, and itself over the long term.\n- Business models are essential for startups and established companies alike, as they help unlock sustainable value and guide experimentation in the marketplace.\n\n### **Key Distinctions**\n- **Not a Business Plan:** A business model is different from a business plan. While a business plan is a static document with projections and assumptions, a business model is dynamic and focused on real-world experimentation.\n- **Not Just Revenue Strategy:** Monetization is only one part of a business model. Other components include operations, customer acquisition, retention, supply chain, and more.\n\n### **Design & Experimentation**\n- Business model design is about building a sustainable value chain, starting with a clear value proposition and focusing on a specific niche before scaling.\n- Experimentation is crucial‚Äîentrepreneurs must test and iterate on their models to find what works in the real world.\n\n### **Innovation**\n- **Technological vs. Business Model Innovation:** While technology can enable new business models, true innovation often comes from rethinking how value is created and delivered, not just from new tech.\n- **Competitive Moats:** Business model innovation can create lasting competitive advantages, especially in the digital era where network effects and platform models are prevalent.\n\n### **Components of a Business Model**\n- **Business Model Canvas:** A popular framework that includes key partners, activities, value proposition, customer relationships, segments, resources, channels, cost structure, and revenue streams.\n- **Lean Startup Canvas:** Focuses on experimentation, customer feedback, and iterative design, especially for startups.\n\n### **FourWeekMBA Perspective**\n- Emphasizes simplicity, noise reduction, branding, distribution, and profitability.\n- Divides business model components into \"people\" (brand, value proposition, positioning) and \"financial\" (customer segments, channels, profit formula) dimensions.\n\n### **Types of Business Models**\nThe document details **30+ business model types**, including:\n- **Hidden Revenue (Asymmetric):** Monetizing user data (e.g., Company1, Company2)\n- **One-for-One:** Social impact with each sale (e.g., TOMS Shoes)\n- **Razor and Blade:** Selling a core product cheaply, accessories at a premium (e.g., Company3)\n- **Peer-to-Peer:** Platforms connecting users directly (e.g., Company4)\n- **Multi-Sided Platforms:** Serving multiple customer groups (e.g., Company5)\n- **Freemium, Subscription, Affiliate, Consulting, Agency, Vertically Integrated, E-commerce Marketplace, Discount, Attention Merchant, Privacy-focused, Franchise, On-Demand, User-Generated Content, Educational, Chain/Franchise Mix, Instant News, Blockchain-based, Multi-brand, Family-owned, Humanist Enterprise, Direct-to-Consumer, Enterprise Sales, Distribution-based**, and more.\n\n### **Key Takeaways**\n- There's no single \"best\" business model‚Äîsuccess depends on context, timing, and market conditions.\n- Business models must evolve as markets and technologies change.\n- Experimentation, clear value propositions, and understanding both people and financial dimensions are critical for building a sustainable business.\n\n---\n\nWould you like a deeper dive into any specific business model type or framework mentioned in the document?",
