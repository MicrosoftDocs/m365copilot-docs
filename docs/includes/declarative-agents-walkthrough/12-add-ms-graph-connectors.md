In this section, you add items ingested by a Microsoft Graph connector to the available knowledge for the agent.

1. Open the `appPackage/declarativeAgent.json` file and update the `capabilities` array to the following value, replacing `policieslocal` with a valid Microsoft Graph connector ID in your Microsoft 365 organization. For more information on finding Microsoft Graph connector IDs, see [Retrieving capabilities IDs for declarative agent manifest](../../declarative-agent-capabilities-ids.md#microsoft-graph-connectors).

    ```json
    "capabilities": [
      {
        "name": "WebSearch"
      },
      {
        "name": "OneDriveAndSharePoint",
        "items_by_url": [
          {
            "url": "https://contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/ProductSupport"
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "TeamsMessages",
        "channels_by_url": [
          {
            "url": "https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/..."
          }
        ]
      },
      {
        "name": "People"
      },
      {
        "name": "GraphicArt"
      },
      {
        "name": "CodeInterpreter"
      },
      {
        "name": "GraphConnectors",
        "connections": [
          {
            "connection_id": "policieslocal"
          }
        ]
      }
    ]
    ```

    For more information, see [Microsoft Graph connectors object](../../declarative-agent-manifest-1.3.md#microsoft-graph-connectors-object).

    > [!NOTE]
    >
    > - Not specifying the `connections` array causes all Microsoft Graph connectors content in your Microsoft 365 organization that is available to the logged in user to be available to the agent.

1. Select **Provision** in the **Lifecycle** pane of the Teams Toolkit.

The declarative agent will have access to Microsoft Graph connectors content to generate its answers after you reload the page.
