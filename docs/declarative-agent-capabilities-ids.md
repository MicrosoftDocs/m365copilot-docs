# Retrieving capabilities IDs for declarative agent manifest

This article describes methods for developers to retrieve the necessary IDs to include Graph connectors and SharePoint/OneDrive files within the `capabilities` section of their [declarative agent manifest](declarative-agent-manifest-1.3.md). Developers can use [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) or [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](/powershell/microsoftgraph/overview).

## Microsoft Graph connectors

This section describes how developers can retrieve the value to set in the `connection_id` property of the [Connection object](declarative-agent-manifest-1.3.md#connection-object) in the [Microsoft Graph connectors object](declarative-agent-manifest-1.3.md#microsoft-graph-connectors-object) in the manifest.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Querying for Microsoft Graph connectors requires an admin account.

### [Graph Explorer](#tab/explorer)

1. Browse to [Microsoft Graph Explorer](https://developer.microsoft.com/graph/graph-explorer) and sign in with your admin account.

1. Select your user avatar in the upper right corner and select **Consent to permissions**.

    :::image type="content" source="assets/images/declarative-agents/graph-explorer-consent-to-permissions.png" alt-text="A screenshot of the user profile flyout in Graph Explorer":::

1. Search for `ExternalConnection.Read.All` and select **Consent** for that permission. Follow the prompts to grant consent.

    :::image type="content" source="assets/images/declarative-agents/graph-explorer-get-connections.png" alt-text="A screenshot of Graph Explorer's request field with the connections query":::

1. Locate the connector you want and copy its `id` property. For example, to use the **GitHub Repos** connector in the following response, copy the `githubrepos` value.

    ```json
    {
      "@odata.context": "https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/$metadata#connections(id,name)",
      "value": [
        {
          "id": "applianceparts",
          "name": "Appliance Parts Inventory"
        },
        {
          "id": "githubrepos",
          "name": "GitHub Repos"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

### [PowerShell](#tab/powershell)

1. Copy the following code into a new file named **GetGraphConnectorIds.ps1**.

    :::code language="powershell" source="assets/scripts/GetGraphConnectorIds.ps1":::

1. Open [PowerShell 7](/powershell/scripting/overview) in the directory where **GetGraphConnectorIds.ps1** is located and run the script with the following command.

    ```powershell
    .\GetGraphConnectorIds.ps1
    ```

1. Open your browser and browse to `https://microsoft.com/devicelogin`. Enter the code that is provided by the prompt and complete the sign-in and consent flow.

    ```powershell
    To sign in, use a web browser to open the page https://microsoft.com/devicelogin and enter the code BQGGRREGN to authenticate.
    ```

1. Locate the connector you want and copy its `Id` property. For example, to use the **GitHub Repos** connector in the following response, copy the `githubrepos` value.

    ```powershell
    Name                      Id
    ----                      --
