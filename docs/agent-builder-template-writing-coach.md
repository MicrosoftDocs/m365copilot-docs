# Use the Writing Coach template to build an agent

## Overview

The Writing Coach agent is designed to help users improve their writing skills and complete various writing tasks. Acting as a supportive coach, it provides detailed feedback on clarity, coherence, grammar, and tone. It assists in modifying the nuance and tone of messages, translating text, and guides users through writing instructions, stories, and whitepapers.
