Next, run the agent:

1. Open a command prompt and go to the folder where the repository is.
2. Type the following command: `jupyter notebook`. This opens a web page that contains all your scripts.
3. To make sure your LangChain setup is working, start with a simple agent:

    1. Select the **firstAgent** script. It will open in a separate page.
    2. Click the **run** icon. You should see the following output.

        :::image type="content" source="../../assets/images/jupyter-output.png" alt-text="An image that shows the jupyter output." border="false":::

The script does the following:

- Sets the variables from the .env file.
- Uses the gpt-4o-mini model.
- Asks the agent to act like a character from Star Wars.
- The `Hello! What are you up to?` text is the user query that is passed to the agent.
- The `*Roooaaarrr!......` text is the output generated by the agent.

> [!NOTE]
> If you run into an error because modules aren't available, you can install those Python packages from inside Jupyter Notebook. Go to a new line and type:
>
> `%pip install {package-name}`

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first agent. You can change characters and text input fields and run the script again to see what your agent does.
