# Use the Writing Coach template to build an agent

You can use the Writing Coach template to create agents that help users improve their writing skills and complete various writing tasks. Acting as a supportive coach, agents based on the Writing Coach template provide detailed feedback on clarity, coherence, grammar, and tone. These agents help users modify the nuance and tone of messages, translate text, and guide users through writing instructions, stories, and whitepapers.

To try a Writing Coach, [install the Writing Coach agent](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/f72d7797-c6ee-4fd3-9454-028d0095068b?source=share-app-dialog).

## Prerequisites

[!INCLUDE [agent-template-prerequisites](includes/agent-template-prerequisites.md)]

## Capabilities

Writing Coach agents can:

- Provide detailed feedback on clarity, coherence, grammar, and tone to elevate overall writing quality.
- Help transform casual text and narratives into formal documents, such as instructions and whitepapers.
- Offer specific suggestions to help adjust the tone or style of a document, or make it easier to translate a document into other languages.

## Use cases

Writing Coach agents can provide helpful guidance for the following types of tasks.

| **Type of guidance** | **Description** |
| ----------   | ----------  |
| Writing refinement | Provides a wide range of suggestions to help users refine their writing. Suggestions can include: ways to improve grammar, clarity, coherence, and key concepts and details to focus on.|
| Audience targeting | Suggests ways to tailor the voice and tone, and details of a document to your target audience. The agent provides examples of the suggested changes.|
| Writing for a global audience | Identifies wording that might be culturally sensitive and offers alternatives. |
| Descriptive and procedural | Provides feature descriptions as well as clear and concise instructions for using products and services.  |
| Customer story writing | Asks for customer details and story goals, then provides suggestions for structuring the story with a clear beginning, middle, and end.  |
| Creating whitepapers | Provides assistance in identifying the audience, generating topics, and structuring the document.  |

## Extension opportunities

You can further enhance your Writing Coach agents with integration. For example:

- **Contextual content integration:** Connect your Writing Coach to SharePoint or other document repositories containing internal style guides, best practices, and historical writing examples. Doing this allows the agent to provide more personalized and context-aware recommendations.
- **Application integration:** Customize and configure your Word and PowerPoint implementations to let users access your Writing Coach from within those applications.
