# Code interpreter examples

The code interpreter capability allows declarative agents to write and run Python code in a sandboxed environment. This capability enables agents to solve complex tasks iteratively, such as data analysis, generate visualizations, and solve mathematical problems. It uses the reasoning model to write and run Python code, enabling users to solve complex math problems, analyze data, generate visualizations, and more. After the code runs, code interpreter outputs the results and the generated code. It can also produce images or files based on the scenario and accepts files as input for modifications and analysis.

With code interpreter, you can allow your users to:

- [Create graphs and charts](#create-graphs-and-charts)
- [Create data visualizations and QR Codes](#create-data-visualizations-and-qr-codes)
- [Create Synthetic data](#create-synthetic-data)
- [Solve complex math problems](#solve-complex-math-problems)
- [Modify uploaded images](#modify-uploaded-images)

## Create graphs and charts

This versatile capability can be used in various ways. For example, users can prompt the agent to "Graph the first 20 numbers in a Fibonacci sequence", which produces a line graph like this:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-fibonacci-line-graph.png" alt-text="Screenshot of a line graph showing the first 20 numbers of a Fibonacci sequence.":::

When the user selects the `</> Code` button, the agent provides the corresponding Python code:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-fibonacci-python.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the Python code for graphing the first 20 numbers of a Fibonacci sequence.":::

Users can also upload various types of data files to generate graphs and charts so they can visualize their data. For example, a user could upload a file with sales data and request a bar chart or line graph of the data. For example, the user prompt: "Create a bar chart and line graph of my uploaded sales data." returns the following response:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-sales-data-bar-chart.png" alt-text="Bar chart of sample sales data":::

and

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-sales-data-line-graph.png" alt-text="Line graph of sample sales data":::

## Create data visualizations and QR Codes

With code interpreter enabled, users can create a variety of data visualizations, such as QR codes and word clouds. For instance, the user prompt "Create a QR code for Microsoft's corporate website" the agent presents both the corresponding URL and matching QR code:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-generated-qr-code.png" alt-text="QR code for Microsoft generated by Copilot":::

For a word cloud, the prompt "Create a word cloud of top pet names" generates an image that includes the top names, as shown in the following example.

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-pet-word-cloud.png" alt-text="Word cloud response to the user prompt":::

## Create Synthetic data

When a user needs sample data to work with, integrating code interpreter allows them to create synthetic data for a variety of purposes in several formats. Here are a couple of examples:

**User prompt:** "Create a table of 10 fake financial transactions including date, amount, merchant, and category."

**Response:**
:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-synthetic-financials.png" alt-text="Table of synthetic financial transactions.":::

**User prompt:** "Generate 20 synthetic customer support chat transcripts about billing issues."

**Response:**
:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-synthetic-chats.png" alt-text="Table of synthetic customer support chats.":::

## Solve complex math problems

With code interpreter enabled, users can also have your agent solve complex math problems. For example, users can have your agent solve complex math problems, such as this calculus example:

**User prompt:** Provide the integral of the area under the curve for the function \( f(x) = x^3 - 4x^2 + 6x - 2 \) from \( x = 0 \) to \( x = 3 \).

**Response:**

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/code-interpreter-integral-calc-and-graph.png" alt-text="Integral calculation for the area under a curve.":::

## Modify uploaded images

Code interpreter also allows users to modify uploaded images. It can add banners and captions, as well as generate black and white images from color images. For instance, say they started with this image, which was previously generated by Copilot:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/1934-bentley-copilot-image.png" alt-text="Image generated by Copilot of a 1934 Bentely 4 car.":::

The user could then enter the prompt "Give me a black and white version of the attached image. Add a banner that says "1934 Bentley 4" and a caption that says "Image generated by Copilot." and get the following result:

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/code-interpreter-examples/bw-1934-bentley-result.png" alt-text="Black and white image of a 1934 Bentley 4 car, modified by Copilot.":::
