# Build agents with Copilot Studio agent builder

The Copilot Studio agent builder provides a simple interface that you can use to quickly and easily build declarative agents, either by using natural language or manually.

To get started with the Copilot Studio agent builder, open the Microsoft 365 Copilot app, and in the right rail, choose **Create agents**. You can also choose **Create agents** from Microsoft 365 Copilot in Teams.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot Studio agent builder capabilities differ based on the user's license. For details, see [Agent capabilities for Microsoft 365 users](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/prerequisites#agent-capabilities-for-microsoft-365-users).

You can author your declarative agent in two ways:

- Via the **Describe** tab, using natural language
- Via the **Configure** tab where you can build it manually

Both tabs work seamlessly to provide a rich authoring experience.

> [!NOTE]
> The **Describe** tab is only available when your Microsoft 365 language is set to one of the [available languages](copilot-studio-agent-builder-availability.md). You can build your agent via the **Configure** tab if the **Describe** tab isn't supported in your preferred language.

## Describe your agent

The **Describe** tab allows you to create an agent using plain language. As you provide information conversationally, the agent's name, description, and instructions update continuously to refine the agent's behavior. This experience provides a rich yet simple natural language way to create a customized agent. After you create an agent, you can return to the agent and use the **Describe** tab to update it using natural language.

You build agents in plain language by answering the questions the agent builder asks. The builder progressively updates the agent in each turn of the conversation, and changes are saved automatically. You can make updates to the agent in any turn of the conversation. Changes to the agent's name, description, and instructions update automatically. However, you can't add an icon or knowledge sources directly from the **Describe** tab. Use the **Configure** tab to add an icon, knowledge sources, or capabilities.

## Configure your agent

In addition to using the **Describe** tab, you can also directly configure the agent's behavior using the **Configure** tab.

The **Configure** tab provides you with the ability to view and edit information about the agent, giving you more control and more precision. The **Describe** and **Configure** tabs are in sync. The fields in the **Configure** tab update to reflect the latest changes from the **Describe** tab. You can switch between the tabs to use the experience that is most comfortable to you to author the agent.

The following table describes the fields that make up the agent.

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->
| Field               | Description |
| ------------------- | ----------- |
| **Name**            | The name of your agent. Use something that is descriptive and unique. Character limit of 30 characters. |
| **Icon**            | You can manually upload an image to represent your agent and give it a unique personality. <ul><li>Supported file types: PNG</li><li>Color icon resolution limit: 192x192 pixels</li><li>File size limit: 1 MB</li></ul> A PNG file with a transparent background works best due to the extra padding that is applied by default around your icon. |
| **Description**     | The description helps the Large Language Model (LLM) identify and use your agent for a specific task or situation. Make it as short, precise, and simple as possible. It's also displayed in the app file for use in the app catalog. Character limit of 1,000 characters. |
| **Instructions**    | Specific instructions to the LLM that you want to use to extend the capabilities of Microsoft 365 Copilot. They direct the behavior of the agent, including its tasks and how it completes them. If you're using the **Describe** tab, they're autogenerated for you. Character limit of 8,000 characters. For more information, see [Write effective instructions](declarative-agent-instructions.md).|
| **Knowledge**       | You can specify up to 20 knowledge sources (including SharePoint sites, folders, and files) or Copilot connectors. For details, see the [Add knowledge sources](#add-knowledge-sources) section. |
| **Capabilities** | You can enhance the user experience of your declarative agent by adding capabilities. For details, see [Add capabilities](#add-capabilities). |
| **Starter Prompts** | Starter prompts help other users understand commonly supported scenarios by your agent. Each starter prompt comes with a name and description. There's no minimum number of starter prompts. |

## Try your agent

The agent in the right pane is an ephemeral instance of the agent that shows up as a side-by-side screen within the authoring experience. You can use it to test the agent while you're creating or making updates to it. You can test your agent in the test pane to experience it in a similar way to end users. The test pane is enabled after the agent has name, description, and instructions. It behaves according to those instructions like a fully fledged agent, including the ability to respond to complex queries within its realm of specified knowledge. The agent updates during each turn of the conversation as new information is added in the **Describe** or **Configure** tab.

The agent you see in the test pane isn't created yet, so some features aren't available. For example, you can't use it to share prompts, provide feedback, or @mention other agents in the Microsoft 365 Copilot app. These features become available after you create the agent.

The test pane initially appears with suggested starter prompts, which when clicked invokes the prompt and starts the conversation. You can select **New Chat** to start a new conversation with the agent to view the starter prompts again.

## Add knowledge sources

The agent builder allows you to configure specific knowledge sources for your agent to reference. This feature helps the agent provide more relevant answers. You can add any of the following types of knowledge sources:

- Websites
- SharePoint files, folders, and sites
- Embedded files uploaded from your device
- Microsoft 365 Copilot connectors (formerly Microsoft Graph connectors)

### Websites

You can add specific public websites as agent knowledge sources to make your agent context-aware. When you reference websites as knowledge sources, the following limits apply:

- Public website URLs must only be two levels; for example, `https://example.org/a/b/c` is an invalid URL because it's more than two levels.
- URLs can't contain query parameters; for example, `https://example.org?test=1` is invalid.
- You can add up to four URLs.

To configure your agent to use any web data as knowledge, on the **Configure** tab, click the **Knowledge** box, and choose **All websites**.

### SharePoint content

You can reference specific SharePoint sites, files, and folders as agent knowledge sources. When you reference sources from SharePoint, consider the following limits:

- A total of 20 knowledge sources (including SharePoint sites, folders, and files and [files uploaded from the device](#uploaded-files)) can be selected for each agent.
- Files already uploaded to SharePoint might have existing permissions and [sensitivity labels](/purview/sensitivity-labels), which are respected when the agent is generating a response.

For information about SharePoint knowledge file size limits, see [File size limits](#file-size-limits).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If [Restricted SharePoint Search](/sharepoint/restricted-sharepoint-search) is enabled, you can't use SharePoint as a knowledge source.

#### Entering a URL for a SharePoint site, folder, or file

You can enter a URL for a SharePoint site, folder, or file, such as `contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies`. The agent searches the URL and subpaths. For example, a URL such as `contoso.sharepoint.com/sites` also includes subpaths like `contoso.sharepoint.com/sites/policies`. The agent uses relevant information to provide a targeted response.

After you provide the SharePoint URL, press **Enter** to add it as a knowledge source.

#### SharePoint file picker

You can also select files or folders from the SharePoint file picker. The left pane displays your recently accessed SharePoint sites. To view more SharePoint sites, select **More places**. If you recently created a site, it will appear after several minutes.

> [!NOTE]
> The SharePoint picker might not show all the [communication sites](/microsoft-365/community/team-site-or-communication-site) that you have access to. Communication sites only show up in the **Quick Access** and **Recent** sections of the SharePoint picker.

After you select a site, you can select several files and folders. Doing so adds the SharePoint file or folder to the agent's knowledge sources. When the same site includes multiple folders, select the button next to the folder name to view other folders.

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/copilot-studio-agent-builder/embedded-authoring-sharepoint-picker-folders.png" alt-text="SharePoint file picker":::

You can also upload files into SharePoint by using the picker. The file appears in the same folder after it finishes uploading and is ready for use in agent builder.

#### File readiness

When new files are uploaded to SharePoint, they can take up to several minutes to be ready for the agent to include in its response. You can still test your agent in the test pane if sources aren't ready. However, responses don't information from the newly uploaded file until it's ready.

You can check the file readiness by looking in the **Knowledge** section in the **Configure** tab; the file has the word "Preparing" next to it. When the underlying file uploaded to SharePoint is renamed or deleted, the agent picks up the changes. You can also select the reload button on top of the **Knowledge** section to manually reload the state.

:::image type="content" source="assets/images/copilot-studio-agent-builder/embedded-authoring-knowledge-preparing.png" alt-text="Knowledge sources preparing state":::

### Embedded files

You can upload files directly from your device for your agent to use as embedded knowledge. You can simply drag-and-drop files from your device into the **Describe** tab or the **Knowledge** box on the **Configure** tab. On the **Configure** tab, you can also choose the arrow icon to upload files from your device or choose the cloud icon to upload files from SharePoint.

You can add up to 20 files as knowledge sources, included files uploaded from your device and SharePoint sites, folders, and files. You can't use this feature to upload folders from your device.

For information about size limits for uploaded files, see [File size limits](#file-size-limits).

Embedded files are displayed on the **Configure** tab under **Uploaded files**. Files can take a few minutes to upload and appear gray until they're fully uploaded. The upload time can vary based on the file size and internet speed.

The following file types aren't supported:

- Files with sensitivity labels with double key encryption, extract rights disabled, or user-defined permissions.
- Files from another tenant that has encryption enabled.
- Password protected files.

For information about sensitivity labels applied to files used as knowledge, see [Sensitivity labels](#sensitivity-labels).

> [!CAUTION]
> When you upload files as knowledge sources for your agent, any user who has access to the agent has access to the information in the file. The agent doesn't honor permissions that are applied to files.

#### Sensitivity labels

Agents protect content that is restricted by [sensitivity labels](/purview/sensitivity-labels). In tenants that have sensitivity labeling enabled, the label shows next to the file under **Uploaded files**. If a knowledge source is restricted via a sensitivity label, users who don't have access permissions to that knowledge source can't use the agent. The user can see the agent title and description in the Agent Store, but they can't access or use the agent.

For information about how to enable sensitivity labels in your tenant, see [Enable sensitivity labels for files in SharePoint and OneDrive](/purview/sensitivity-labels-sharepoint-onedrive-files) and [Enable coauthoring for files encrypted with sensitivity labels](/purview/sensitivity-labels-coauthoring).

#### Agent sensitivity labels

If embedded files have sensitivity labels applied, a sensitivity label is also applied to the agent. The label reflects the most restrictive sensitivity label applied to the embedded files. For example, if a file with a General label and a file with a Confidential label are uploaded, the sensitivity label applied to the agent is Confidential. This label reflects the level of sensitivity of the files embedded in the agent; currently, agent builders can't set or change sensitivity labels that are applied to agents.

If the embedded files don't have sensitivity labels applied, the default label for the tenant is applied to the agent. If the tenant doesn't have a default sensitivity label, no label is applied to the agent.

The sensitivity label appears on the top right corner of the agent after the user adds it. Currently, sensitivity labels don't appear on the Agent Store listing. If a user doesn't have permission to an embedded knowledge source, they can't add the agent from the store.

#### Sharing an agent with uploaded files

When you share an agent with uploaded files, the files are also shared, and agent users can get responses from Copilot based on those knowledge sources. You have the following options for sharing an agent with uploaded files as knowledge:

- Anyone in your organization
- Specific users in your organization
- Only you

Sharing an agent with uploaded files to groups isn't currently supported.

When you [share the agent](/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/copilot-studio-agent-builder-publish#share-the-agent), if sensitivity labels are enabled, a label that represents the highest sensitivity label applied to any uploaded files or the default sensitivity label of the tenant (whichever is highest) is displayed on the **Share** screen.

### File size limits

The following table lists the file types that you can add as knowledge to your agent and the size limits for each file type, whether you're adding the files from SharePoint or uploading from your device.

| File type | SharePoint Online limit | Uploaded file limit |
| ----------| ----------------------- | ------------------- |
| .doc      | 150 MB                  | 30 MB |
| .docx     | 512 MB                  | 30 MB |
| .html     | 150 MB                  | NA    |
| .pdf      | 512 MB                  | 30 MB |
| .ppt      | 150 MB                  | 30 MB |
| .pptx     | 512 MB                  | 30 MB |
| .txt      | 150 MB                  | 30 MB |
| .xls      | 150 MB                  | 30 MB |
| .xlsx     | 150 MB                  | 30 MB |

### Copilot connectors

Copilot connectors allow agents to include knowledge from external repositories or systems such as customer accounts, incident tickets, and knowledge articles. Admins must enable and configure Copilot connectors in the [Microsoft 365 admin center](/microsoftsearch/configure-connector). At first, the connectors might be collapsed in the **From your organization** section of the **Knowledge** sources.

If at least one connector is enabled, you can add it to your agent. Your agent is able to answer questions related to that connector. The information retrieved from the connector is indexed and refreshed according to the way in which the connector was configured. The agent can cite relevant information from the indexed data and link the end user to the data source.

## Add capabilities

In the **Capabilities** section of the **Configure** tab, you can choose to add the following capabilities to your agent:

- [Code interpreter](code-interpreter.md) - Uses Python code to solve complex math problems, analyze data, and generate visualizations.
- [Image generator](image-generator.md) - Generates images base on user prompts.

To add one or more capabilities to your agent, choose the toggle next to the capability you want to enable.

## Build from a template

Copilot Studio agent builder includes templates that you can use to build agents for specific use cases. The templates are preconfigured with a description, instructions, and prompts. You can use the templates as-is or customize them for your specific needs, including by adding knowledge sources and capabilities. For more information, see [Agent builder templates overview](agent-builder-templates.md) or choose one of the templates on the **Describe** or **Configure** tab in agent builder.
