# Copilot Studio agent templates

The Copilot Studio lite experience (formerly agent builder) includes various templates that you can use to create declarative agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot. The templates apply design guidelines and industry best practices to help you get started quickly. This enables you to spend more time customizing the logic and functionality to meet your business requirements. The agent templates accelerate the agent development process to help organizations improve overall operational efficiency.

This article provides information about how to create your own agents using natural language as input.

## Use templates to create an agent

To create an agent from a template:

1. On the **Describe** tab, select a template. You can test the agent in the right pane right away.
2. Using natural language, provide additional information to update and enhance the agent, including the agent name, description, and instructions.
3. On the **Configure** tab, add an icon, knowledge sources, and capabilities to your agent.

You can also configure the agent directly on the **Configure** tab:

1. On the **Configure** tab, select a template from the dropdown in the **Template** field.
2. The agent icon, name, description, instructions, and starter prompts are prepopulated. Update any of the fields to meet your scenario.
3. Add any knowledge sources and capabilities to enhance your agent.

The **Describe** and **Configure** tabs are in sync. You can switch between both tabs based on your preferences to author your agent.

Changes that you make to the agent are saved automatically. When you're satisfied with your agent's behavior and content, choose **Create** on the top right corner of the tool to create your agent.

After the agent is created, choose **Go to agent** in Copilot to chat with the agent. You can return to your agent from the left navigation pane in Copilot.
