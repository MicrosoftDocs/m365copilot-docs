## Limitations

- **Interacting with the agent:** Agents created with the Meeting Coach template are designed to answer just one question at time. For best results, don't ask multiple or compound questions in a single prompt.
- **Handling sensitive information:** When building agents with this template, it is your responsibility to ensure that any personal or sensitive information used in the agent is handled according to your organization's data privacy policies.
- **Incorrect or harmful responses:** Although the agent is designed to prevent the output of incorrect and harmful content, it utilizes generative AI technology, which it can sometimes make mistakes. A disclaimer is included to remind users to verify accuracy before making decisions, especially financial decisions. Customers are responsible for conducting due diligence on AI-generated content. You can edit the disclaimer to align with your organizationâ€™s policies, but we don't recommend removing it.
