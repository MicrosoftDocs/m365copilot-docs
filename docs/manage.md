# Manage agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot

This article summarizes administrator controls for managing Microsoft 365 Copilot agents based on the different ways to build them.

Agents are packaged, distributed, and managed in the same way as other apps that run across the integrated Microsoft 365 platform. At its core, the integrated Microsoft 365 platform extends the Teams app platform to provide a [unified app model](agents-are-apps.md) for extensibility within the Microsoft 365 ecosystem. App management controls for Microsoft 365 are also converging to the centralized Microsoft 365 admin center. However, some necessary controls for Microsoft 365 Copilot agents are accessible only from other admin centers.

## Microsoft 365 admin center

Agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot can be [packaged and distributed as Microsoft 365 apps](./agents-are-apps.md) that are centrally managed from the **Integrated Apps** section of **Microsoft 365 admin center** ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)).

*Global Admin* and *Azure Application Admin* roles can deploy and uninstall apps, manage which apps are available to which users, and block apps in Microsoft 365 admin center.

From Microsoft 365 admin center, admins can:

- Enable/disable Copilot agents for the whole organization through Microsoft 365 admin center settings.
- Deploy, make available, or block agents to the whole organization or specific users or groups.
- Review and approve agents submitted to the organizational catalog.
- Monitor and find information about agents that have been shared across the organization.

## Agents built with Teams Toolkit

Both [declarative agents](./build-declarative-agents.yml) and [custom engine agents](/microsoftteams/platform/teams-ai-library-tutorial?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context) built with Teams Toolkit that are published to the organization or acquired from Microsoft Commercial Marketplace are managed through the **Integrated Apps** section of **Microsoft 365 admin center** ([admin.microsoft.com](https://admin.microsoft.com)).

## Agents built with SharePoint

[Agents that are created for SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-edit-an-agent-d16c6ca1-a8e3-4096-af49-67e1cfdddd42) sites are represented as [`.agent` files](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-edit-an-agent-d16c6ca1-a8e3-4096-af49-67e1cfdddd42#where-agent-file) in each site's *Site Assets* library. As such, permissions on the files govern who can access or edit the agents.

## Microsoft Graph connectors

[Microsoft Graph connectors](./overview-graph-connector.md) can be connected directly to your organizational Microsoft 365 Copilot experience with the Microsoft Graph API, or packaged as part of a Microsoft 365 app for publish to your organization or submission to Microsoft Commercial Marketplace. Depending on the control, Microsoft Graph connectors are managed from Microsoft Entra admin center, Microsoft 365 admin center, and Teams admin center.
