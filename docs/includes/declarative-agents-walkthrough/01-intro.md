A declarative agent is a customized version of Microsoft 365 Copilot that allows users to create personalized experiences by declaring specific instructions, actions, and knowledge. This guide provides information about how to build a declarative agent by using Teams Toolkit.

The agent that you build in this tutorial targets licensed Microsoft 365 Copilot users. You can also build agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot Chat users, with limited capabilities. For details, see [Agent capabilities for Microsoft 365 users](../../prerequisites.md#agent-capabilities-for-microsoft-365-users).
