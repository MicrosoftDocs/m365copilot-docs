> - API plugins are currently only supported as actions within [declarative agents](../overview-declarative-agent.md). They aren't enabled in Microsoft 365 Copilot. For an example that shows how to add an API plugin to a declarative agent, see [Add a plugin](../build-declarative-agents.yml?tutorial-step=7).
> - The capability is enabled by default in all Microsoft 365 Copilot-licensed tenants. Admins can disable this functionality on a user and group basis and control how individual plugins are approved for use, and which plugins are enabled. For more information, see [Manage Agents in Integrated Apps](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/manage-plugins-for-copilot-in-integrated-apps?context=/microsoft-365-copilot/extensibility/context).
