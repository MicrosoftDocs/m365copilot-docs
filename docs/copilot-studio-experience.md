# Choose the right Copilot Studio experience to build your agent

Microsoft Copilot Studio offers two ways to build AI agents for Microsoft 365: a lite experience (integrated into the Microsoft 365 Copilot app) and a full experience (a standalone Copilot Studio application). Both experiences enable you to create powerful agents, but they serve different needs. This article describes the differences between the lite and full experiences to help you choose the right Copilot Studio experience for your scenario.

## Comparing the lite and full Copilot Studio experiences

The following list summarizes when to choose which Copilot Studio experience:

- **Choose the lite experience** if you want to quickly create an agent for yourself or a small team, using natural language and existing content (for example, a bot that answers questions from your team’s SharePoint files or emails). The lite version is simple, accessible, and integrated with the Microsoft 365 Copilot experience, so you can build agents in context without any code.

- **Choose the full experience** if you need an agent for a broader audience (such as your whole department, organization, or external customers) or if the agent requires advanced capabilities like multi-step workflows or custom integrations, or more control over deployment and management. The full version of Copilot Studio is a standalone web portal with a rich set of tools for complex or scalable solutions.

The following table provides a more detailed feature comparison.

| Feature | Lite experience | Full experience |
| ------- | --------------- | --------------- |
| Access point | Microsoft 365 Copilot app or Teams chat | Web app or Teams app |
| Target audience | Individuals or small teams. Best for individual productivity or specific team projects. | Department, organization, or external customers. Best for agents that are available across a company or for customers or partners outside the organization. |
| Agent type | Simple Q&A agents with tailored organizational knowledge. | Agents with complex scenarios like multi-step workflows and database or business system integration. Agents that require enterprise governance and robust controls. |
| Key capabilities |  |  |
| Use cases |  |  |
| Management and governance |  |  |

## Licensing

Both the lite and full Copilot Studio experiences are included with a Microsoft 365 Copilot add-on license. If you don’t have a Copilot license, you can use Copilot Studio message packs or a pay-as-you-go plan to access either experience.

You can also use the lite experience for free to build web-only agents.
