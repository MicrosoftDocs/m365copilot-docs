# Build custom engine agents with Teams AI Library

**Teams AI library** is a Teams-centric interface for integrating GPT-based language models and user intent engines. It includes a built-in action planner orchestrator and simplifies the development process by reducing the need to write and maintain complex conversational bot logic.

Now with the new v2 SDK, it supports Agent2Agent (A2A) for multi-agent collaboration and Model Context Protocol (MCP) for shared memory and tools. 

## When to use Teams AI Library v2

- You're looking to tailor model selection, but want to use an orchestrator provided by SDK.
- You want to apply your prior experience with Teams bot development.
- You want to make your agents available to all Microsoft 365 users.
- You want your agents interact in real time with users in a collaborative team-based environment.
