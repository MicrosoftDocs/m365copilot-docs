# Enable feedback for your agent

You can help improve the performance and accuracy of your declarative agents by enabling the feedback settings across all Microsoft 365 apps. When you do so, users can rate the responses your agents generate and provide logs, screenshots, and contact email addresses when they submit their feedback. 

This article explains how to configure the feedback settings for Microsoft 365 apps, how to review and set policies to manage how users submit and interact with feedback, and how to send diagnostic logs for Copilot issues on behalf of users.

## Review specific policies you can configure

The following table identifies the relevant feedback policies you can configure.

| Policy name | Default state | Control summary |
| ----------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Allow users access to feedback portal  | On | Manage user access to the feedback portal where users can follow up on their feedback and participate in community feedback. |
| Allow users to submit feedback to Microsoft | On | Controls feedback entry points across applications. |
| Allow users to receive and respond to in-product surveys from Microsoft | On | Controls survey prompts within product. |
| Allow users to include screenshots and attachments when they submit feedback to Microsoft | On | Allows users to choose relevant files, screen recordings, and screenshots to help Microsoft better understand and troubleshoot their feedback. |
| Allow Microsoft to follow up on feedback submitted by users | On | Determines if user can share contact info with feedback/survey for follow-up by Microsoft. Also allows users to get notified of feedback status changes. Users can manage communications settings in the feedback portal. |
| Allow users to include log files and content samples when feedback is submitted to Microsoft | On | Allows users to include Microsoft generated files such as additional log files and content samples when relevant to feedback they're submitting. Examples might include Microsoft 365 Copilot prompt and response interactions. |

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The **Allow users to access the feedback portal** policy requests the policies for the person who signs in. It is classed as a cloud policy because the feedback portal is a web application that makes a call to the cloud policy service, and the cloud policy service is also a web application. If the **Allow users to access the feedback portal** policy is configured, the feedback portal receives the configured policy value in the response from the cloud policy service.
>
> The **Allow users to access the feedback portal** policy isn’t defined in the Administrative Template (.ADMX) files used in Windows environments to define Group Policy settings and doesn’t have a corresponding registry key available to set the policy. To improve security, you should create a cloud policy to enforce it.
