Now that your agent is up and running, you can give it a UI and host it so that you can access it in a browser similar to ChatGPT. You use the Chainlit Python package to do this.

1. Open a command prompt and go to the folder that contains **ClippywithUI.py**.
2. Run the following command: `Chainlit run ClippywithUI.py -w`.
