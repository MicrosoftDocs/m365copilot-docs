# Design icons for agent acquisition and management

A Copilot agent is an app for Microsoft 365, and its [app package](agents-are-apps.md#app-package) must include two icon files that represent the agent in the app acquisition and managment UI of Teams, Office, Copilot, and other Microsoft 365 applications. This article describes the requirements and best practices for creating these icons.
