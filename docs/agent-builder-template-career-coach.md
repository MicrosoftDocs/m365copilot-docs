# Use the Career Coach template to build an agent

You can use the Career Coach template to build an agent that provides personalized suggestions and action plans to help users advance in their careers. The career coach offers tailored advice on skill development, learning opportunities, and career transitions based on the user's current role, experience, and available learning opportunities.  

The Career Coach uses a professional and supportive tone to make interactions contextually relevant and encouraging.

To try a Career Coach, [install the Career Coach agent](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/app/89b7d7a3-fae0-47d7-8140-a38efe34510f?source=share-app-dialog).
