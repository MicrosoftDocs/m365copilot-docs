# Agent builder templates overview

Copilot Studio agent builder includes a variety of templates that you can use to create declarative agents for Microsoft 365 Copilot. The templates apply design guidelines and industry best practices to help you get started quickly so you can spend more time customizing the logic and functionality to meet your business requirements. Using templates provides a streamlined approach that accelerates the development process and allows organizations to improve overall operational efficiency.

This article provides information about how to use the templates in agent builder to create your own agents.

## Use templates to create an agent

To create an agent from a template in agent builder by using natural language:

1. In agent builder, on the **Describe** tab, select a template. You can test the agent in the right pane right away.
2. Using natural language, provide additional information to update and enhance the agent, including the agent name, description, and instructions.
3. On the **Configure** tab, add an icon, knowledge sources, and additional capabilities to your agent.

You can also configure the agent directly on the **Configure** tab in agent builder:

1. On the **Configure** tab, select a template from the dropdown in the **Template** field.
2. The agent icon, name, description, instructions, and starter prompts are prepopulated. Update any of the fields to meet your scenario. You can also add knowledge and capabilities to enhance your agent.

Note that the **Describe** and **Configure** tabs are in sync. You can switch between both tabs based on your preferences to author your agent.

Changes that you make to the agent are saved automatically in agent builder. When you're satisfied with your agent's behavior and content, choose **Create** on the top right corner of agent builder to create your agent. 

After the agent is created, choose **Go to agent** in Copilot to chat with the agent. You can return to your agent any time from the right rail in Copilot.
