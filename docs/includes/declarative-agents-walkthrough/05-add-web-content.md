In this section, you add the ability to search the web to the agent.

1. Open the `appPackage/declarativeAgent.json` file and add the `capabilities` array with the following content.

    ```json
    "capabilities": [
      {
        "name": "WebSearch"
      }
    ]
    ```

    For more information, see [Web search object](../../declarative-agent-manifest-1.3.md#web-search-object).

1. Select **Provision** in the **Lifecycle** pane of the Teams Toolkit.

The declarative agent will have access to web content to generate its answers after you reload the page.
