## Limitations

The following limitations apply to this template:

- **Interacting with the agent:** Agents created with this template are designed to answer one question at time. For best results, users shouldn't ask multiple or compound questions in a single prompt.
- **Handling sensitive information:** When you create agents with this template, it's your responsibility to ensure that any personal or sensitive information used in the agent is handled according to your organization's data privacy policies.
- **Incorrect or harmful responses:** Although agents based on this template are designed to prevent the output of incorrect and harmful content, these agents use generative AI technology, which can sometimes make mistakes. A disclaimer is included to remind users to verify accuracy before making decisions, especially financial decisions. Customers are responsible for conducting due diligence on AI-generated content. You can edit the disclaimer to align with your organization's policies, but we don't recommend removing it.
