# Use the Meeting Coach template to build an agent

## Overview

The Meeting Coach declarative agent template is designed to assist meeting organizers in creating and running effective meetings. It can help you:

- set clear objectives
- create structured agendas
- assign meeting roles
- prepare meeting invitations
- keep meetings on track
- encouraging participation
- assigning action items

 Agents built from this template help ensure that meetings are productive, engaging, and well-organized. You can even customize the agent's knowledge base to fit your needs with internal knowledge sources and publicly available websites.

## Extension opportunities

If you have a metered subscription or the appropriate license, you can enhance the functionality of your Meeting Coach agents by:

- **Connecting to your (CRM) solution:** Use a Power Platform Connector an API plugin to provide your agent access to details about your key account and customer contacts as well as to relevant products and projects. (Typically, CRM integration requires collaboration with your organizations service owners and IT department.)
- **Connecting to SharePoint:** Connecting your agents is particularly useful for the following use cases:
    - **Customer engagement:** By connecting SharePoint sites that include meeting materials (sales pitches, customer information, etc.) you can create an agent specialized for customer follow-up.
    - **Standardizing meetings across teams:** By connecting SharePoint sites that include template files (agendas, meeting minutes, etc.), you can standardize how meetings are organized. You can also standardize how action items and results are recorded and reported at the end of the meeting.
