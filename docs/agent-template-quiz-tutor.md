# Use the Quiz Tutor template to build an agent

You can use the Quiz Tutor template in the lite experience of Copilot Studio to build agents that provide fun, bite-sized quizzes based on predefined training content. These quizzes can even be interactive to make the learning process more engaging. The template is designed to enhance a user's understanding and retention of the material by using varied and interesting questions and providing coaching and feedback to support learning.

- Use clear language, not technical jargon.
