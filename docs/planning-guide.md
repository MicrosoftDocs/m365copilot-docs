# Microsoft 365 Copilot extensibility planning guide

Microsoft 365 Copilot is an AI-powered productivity tool that combines knowledge and skills to assist users in the flow of their work. You can build extensibility solutions that tailor and enhance the Copilot experience for your users to meet your organization's unique business needs.

Planning is an important first step in designing and building your extensibility solution. This article provides the key steps to follow to help you plan your Copilot extensibility solution.

## Define your objectives

Before you design your Copilot extensibility solution, define the purpose and scope of what you plan to build. This involves the following steps:

- Identify the problem you're solving.
- Understand your target users.
- Define how your solution can address the business problem.

To start, define the specific challenge or productivity gap that you need to address. Identify the inefficiencies, pain points, or unmet needs that exist for your users. After you identify the problem that you need to solve, you can explore how to provide value by extending Copilot.

Next, consider what you know about your target users, and how you can help them with their productivity needs. Identify the user persona or personas you're targeting, and the outcomes you want to achieve for the organization. Consider the following questions:

- Will the number of potential users impact design choices, such as consumption costs?
- Do your users have Copilot licenses? If not, what are the adoption or licensing costs? For details, see [Consider costs](#consider-costs).

After you define the problem or business need that you need to address, identify how you can extend Copilot to solve or mitigate the problem. What do your users need Copilot to do? Use the information in the following table to guide your thinking.

| Business need | Copilot extensibility approach |
|:------------------|:---------|
| Improve decision-making, summarizations, or recommendations | Enhance Copilot's reasoning abilities. |
| Integrate organizational knowledge from databases, documents, or APIs | Enable Copilot to access and use external data. |
| Reduce manual tasks by building automated flows | Create automated workflows to streamline repetitive tasks. |

Also consider:

- Does the workflow involve **multiple steps or conditional decisions**? If so, design structured workflows or multi-step interactions for a smooth user experience.
- Does Copilot need to **dynamically adapt** to user inputs or changing contexts? If so, implement context-aware capabilities to adjust responses based on user needs in real-time.

## Define technical and data requirements

Determine the requirements that your extensibility solution needs to meet. Consider the following factors:

- **User experience requirements**

    Where will your users interact with Copilot? This might be within the context of Microsoft 365 apps (Copilot, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Teams), or third-party apps or websites.

- **Data sources**

    Does Copilot or your solution require internal or external data, such as documents, applications, APIs, or databases? For example, do you need to:

  - Integrate external data into Microsoft 365 apps for contextually relevant responses?
  - Interact with real-time data for business workflows?
  - Interact with other applications to retrieve or update data, run commands, or trigger workflows?

- **Data source integration options**

    For each data source you need to integrate with Copilot, identify whether a Microsoft Graph connector, [Power Platform plugin](/connectors/connector-reference/connector-reference-powerapps-connectors), or REST API is available. If an existing data source integration isn't available, decide whether you want to build a Microsoft Graph connector or an API to enable the integration. The following table provides an example.

    | Data source  | How do you want to use the data in Copilot?                                  | Data source integrations                |
    |--------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
    | Salesforce   |<ul><li>As a knowledge source when asking questions about a customer.</li><li>To update opportunity details.</li></ul>           |<ul><li>Microsoft Graph connector</li><li>API or Power Platform Plugin</li></ul> |

- **Agentic and automation requirements**

    Identify triggers, scheduled workflows, and automation needs.

## Define your solution

Based on your assessment of your users' needs and the technical requirements for your solution, identify what type or types of Copilot extensibility options you'll build.

### Microsoft Graph connectors

Use Microsoft Graph connectors if you need Copilot to integrate external data into Microsoft 365 applications to provide contextually relevant responses. Depending on your scenario, you can choose to do one of the following:

- **Use prebuilt Microsoft Graph connectors**. Identify [prebuilt Microsoft Graph connectors](/microsoftsearch/pre-built-connectors-overview?context=%2Fmicrosoft-365-copilot%2Fextensibility%2Fcontext) that you can configure in your tenant.
- **Build a custom Microsoft Graph connector**. If none of the existing connectors meet your needs, you can build your own. For more information, see [Microsoft Graph connectors](overview-graph-connector.md).

### Agents for Copilot

If Microsoft Graph connectors alone don't meet your needs, you can build an agent to tailor the Copilot experience for your business needs or to connect to your specific data sources.

If you decide to build an agent, you need to determine the following:

- The **type of agent** to build. Depending on your scenario, you might build a declarative agent or a custom engine agent.

  For information to help you choose the right type of agent to build, see [Your extensibility options for Microsoft 365 Copilot](decision-guide.md).

- Whether to use a **low-code or pro-code** approach to building your agent.

The following table lists the low-code and pro-code options that are available based on the type of agent you plan to build.

| Agent type        | Low-code tool options                                 | Pro-code tool options                                      |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| Declarative agent | <ul><li>Copilot Studio agent builder</li><li>>Copilot Studio</li></ul>      | Visual Studio Code + Teams Toolkit                          |
| Custom engine agent| Copilot Studio                                        | <ul><li>Visual Studio Code + Teams AI Library</li><li>Visual Studio Code + Microsoft 365 Agent SDK (Preview)</li><li>Visual Studio 2022</li><li>Semantic Kernel (optional)</li></ul> |

Next, identify the data sources or plugins your agent needs. Data sources might be Microsoft 365 data (Teams messages, email, people, SharePoint sites or folders), Microsoft Graph connectors (prebuilt or custom), or plugins (for real-time data access or external actions).

Finally, if your agent involves complex workflows, you might need a custom orchestrator. For information to help you design your solution, see [using Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/authoring-fundamentals), [Semantic Kernel](/semantic-kernel/overview/), or [LangChain](https://www.langchain.com/).

## Consider costs

Consider the cost implications of your solution design, from both the user and the hosting perspective.

### User license and consumption costs

When you design an agent for Microsoft 365 Copilot, it's important to understand access and usage costs. Users can either access agents through a license or via pay per use. Your agent will be available to users via one of the license types listed in the following table.

| License type                | Cost                               | Best for                        | Agent consumption costs                                           |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|---------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Microsoft 365 Copilot license   | Add-on license required            | Regular to high-usage users    | No additional costs.                                                |
| Microsoft 365 license   | No additional costs for [eligible Microsoft 365 users](/copilot/microsoft-365/microsoft-365-copilot-licensing) | Occasional users              | No cost for instruction/public website grounding; metered charges for shared tenant data (SharePoint, Microsoft Graph connectors) |
| No license                  | Pay-per-use                        | Guest or external users        | Metered consumption charges                                       |

- [Agent capabilities for Microsoft 365 users](prerequisites.md#agent-capabilities-for-microsoft-365-users).

### Hosting costs

Declarative agents are surfaced in Microsoft 365 at no additional cost. Hosting costs for custom engine agents depend on your architecture and your use of AI models and cloud services.

## Address RAI and compliance considerations

Regardless of the solution you choose, you need to be sure that it meets RAI and compliance requirements. Consider the following:

- Does your Copilot extensibility solution require a specific LLM model or fine-tuning for specialized tasks, such as legal research or medical compliance? If so, for information about how to integrate the model with and optimize it for Copilot, see [How to Choose the Right Models for Your Apps | Azure AI](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoftmechanicsblog/how-to-choose-the-right-models-for-your-apps--azure-ai/4271216?form=MG0AV3).
- Make sure that your solution applies [Responsible AI (RAI) principles](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/ai/responsible-ai), data governance, and store publishing (for ISVs) requirements.

## Outline your development approach

After you choose your Copilot extensibility path, decide how you'll structure your development process. To build your solution, start with a minimum viable product (MVP), and then refine based on feedback and performance.

The following table provides examples of extensibility solutions that use different Copilot extensibility options for various user scenarios.
