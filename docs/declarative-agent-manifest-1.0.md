# Declarative agent schema 1.0 for Microsoft 365 Copilot

This article describes the 1.0 schema used by the declarative agent manifest. The manifest is a machine-readable document that provides a Large Language Model (LLM) with the necessary instructions, knowledge, and actions to specialize in addressing a select set of user problems. Declarative agent manifests are referenced by the Microsoft 365 app manifest inside an [app package](agents-are-apps.md#app-package). For details, see the [Microsoft 365 app manifest reference](/microsoft-365/extensibility/schema/declarative-agent-ref).

[!INCLUDE [latest-declarative-agent-manifest](includes/latest-declarative-agent-manifest.md)]

Declarative agents are valuable in understanding and generating human-like text, making them versatile for tasks like writing and answering questions. This specification is focused on the declarative agent manifest that acts as a structured framework to specialize and enhance functionalities a specific user needs.

## JSON schema

The schema described in this document can be found in [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org/) format [here](https://aka.ms/json-schemas/copilot/declarative-agent/v1.0/schema.json).

## Conventions

### Relative references in URLs

Unless specified otherwise, all properties that are URLs MAY be relative references. Relative references in the manifest document are relative the location of the manifest document.

### String length

Unless specified otherwise, all string properties SHOULD be limited to 4K characters. This string length doesn't confer any acceptable size for the entire document. Implementations are free to impose their own practical limits on manifest length.

### Unrecognized properties

JSON objects defined in this document support only the described properties. Unrecognized or extraneous properties in any JSON object SHOULD make the entire document invalid.

### String localization

Localizable strings can use a localization key instead of a literal value. The syntax is `[[key_name]]`, where `key_name` is the key name in the `localizationKeys` property in your localization files. For details on localization, see [Localize your agent](localize-agents.md).

## Declarative agent manifest object

The root of the manifest document is a JSON object that covers required fields, capabilities, conversation starters, and actions.

The declarative agent manifest object contains the following properties.

| Property                | Type                                                                  | Description |

### Example of declarative agent manifest object

The following JSON is an example of required fields within a declarative agent manifest.

```json
{
  "name" : "Repairs agent",
  "description": "This declarative agent is meant to help track any tickets and repairs",
  "instructions": "This declarative agent needs to look at my Service Now and Jira tickets/instances to help me keep track of open items"
