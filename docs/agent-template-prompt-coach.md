# Use the Prompt Coach template to build an agent

You can use the Prompt Coach template in the lite experience of Copilot Studio to build agents that help new Copilot users create effective prompts. Acting as a supportive teacher, these agents guide users through prompt generation, analysis, and improvement. Key features include helping users create well-structured prompts, providing feedback, ensuring compliance with Responsible AI guidelines, troubleshooting, and suggesting examples. The goal is to help users articulate requests clearly for optimal Copilot responses.
