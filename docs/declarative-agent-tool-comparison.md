## Agents Toolkit

If your scenario involves the full control, scalability, and direct API integration of a pro-code approach, [Agents Toolkit](./build-declarative-agents.md) is the best tool to use to create your declarative agent.

The following table lists the pros and cons for using Agents Toolkit.

> [!NOTE]
> Publishing agents via the Microsoft 365 Agents Toolkit isn't supported in [Microsoft 365 Government](https://www.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/government) tenants.

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Pro-code flexibility:** Ideal for developers who prefer Visual Studio Code and want full control over their coding environment, source control, and access to APIs. | **No Power Platform connector support:** Unlike Copilot Studio, Agents Toolkit doesn't support drag-and-drop [Power Platform connectors](/training/modules/introduction-power-platform-developer-resources/) for quick API integration. |
| **Custom API actions:** Enables integration with any API using OpenAPI specifications or custom-built REST APIs, providing flexibility beyond Power Platform connectors. | **No "No-code" UI:** Requires manual JSON editing for agent configuration, rather than a UI-driven toggle system. |
| **Version control and collaboration:** Supports some source control systems, pull requests, and CI/CD for better development practices and team collaboration. | **Limited composability for makers:** Agents built in Agents Toolkit can't be reused in low-code tools such as Copilot Studio. |
| **Fast feature adoption:**  New capabilities (for example, code interpreter) are often available first in Agents Toolkit before they're added to the full or lite Copilot Studio experiences. | **Steeper learning curve:** The Agents Toolkit is designed for professional developers, which can be less accessible for business users and information workers. |
| **Advanced support for Adaptive Cards:** Enables custom UI rendering inside agents using [Adaptive Cards](/training/modules/copilot-declarative-agent-action-api-plugin-adaptive-cards-vsc/), which isn't available in Copilot Studio. |   |
| **Complex application bundling:** Allows integration of agents with Teams apps, personal tabs, messaging extensions, and other Microsoft 365 applications. |  |
| **Experimentation support:** Developers can fork, test, and iterate on agent capabilities without affecting live deployments. | |
| **Copilot connectors and AI enhancements:** Supports rich integrations, including semantic search with [Microsoft 365 Copilot connectors](/graph/connecting-external-content-experiences) and more control over agent reasoning and responses. | |

## Copilot Studio full experience

The full experience in [Microsoft Copilot Studio](/microsoft-copilot-studio/fundamentals-what-is-copilot-studio) is designed for small-scale deployments, such as department-level solutions. It's a great alternative for people who need a low-code tool that is easy to use and that integrates with [Microsoft Power Platform](/power-platform/developer/get-started).

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Easy to use:** Copilot Studio provides a no-code approach that enables business users and information workers to build and customize agents using a drag-and-drop interface without coding. | **Less developer control:** Limited ability to fine-tune API calls, actions, and response formatting. |
| **Power platform connectors:** Enable quick plug-and-play API integration using hundreds of prebuilt connectors. | **No support for source control or CI/CD:** No built-in support for source control systems (Azure DevOps, GitHub) pull requests, or automated deployments. |
| **Great for personal and departmental use:** Fast setup for smaller, targeted agents that don’t require large-scale enterprise governance. | **Limited support for Adaptive Cards:** You can't customize how responses are displayed beyond basic text formatting. |
| **Prebuilt governance and deployment:** Agents are deployed using Copilot Studio’s built-in management tools, reducing complexity for IT teams. | **Slower feature rollout:** Some advanced features are available in Agents Toolkit before they're available in Copilot Studio. |
| **Built-in test agent**: Copilot Studio comes with a built-in test agent that lets you test the agent in real-time. |  |

## Copilot Studio lite experience

The lite experience of Copilot Studio in Microsoft 365 Copilot (formerly Copilot Studio agent builder) is a great option for users with no coding experience who need a guided process for building declarative agents. You can access the lite experience within Copilot Studio via the following apps and paths:

 - **Microsoft 365 Copilot app:** Select the **Create agent** option
 - **Microsoft Teams:** Select the **Microsoft 365 Copilot** tab and then choose **Create agents**.

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Ease of use:** Designed for users to build agents right inside of Microsoft 365 Copilot with no coding experience, using a natural language interface.  |  **Complex workflows:** Doesn't support complex workflows and integrations. |
| **Quick setup:** Provides a guided process for building agents. | **Slower feature rollout:** Some advanced features are available in Agents Toolkit before they're available in Copilot Studio.  |
| **Accessibility:** Suitable for creating personal and group productivity agents without having to write code.  |  |
| **Straightforward agent testing**: The test pane allows users to test the end-user experience of agents directly within the tool. | |
| **Variety of knowledge sources**: Easily add public web, SharePoint, Copilot connector data and more as agent knowledge sources.| |
| **Generate rich content**: Enable image generation and code interpreter with just one click.| |

## SharePoint

The [SharePoint](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-sharepoint-agents-69e2faf9-2c1e-4baa-8305-23e625021bcf) option is suitable for site owners or editors who want to create agents tailored to specific scenarios within the SharePoint environment. Every SharePoint site comes with a [ready-made agent](https://support.microsoft.com/office/get-started-with-sharepoint-agents-69e2faf9-2c1e-4baa-8305-23e625021bcf#ready-made-agent), scoped to the content on that site. Users with site editing permissions can create custom-built agents by changing content scope, identity, and behavior from [multiple locations](https://support.microsoft.com/office/create-and-edit-an-agent-d16c6ca1-a8e3-4096-af49-67e1cfdddd42#locations-create-agent) on the SharePoint site.

| **Pros** | **Cons** |
|:------------|:------------|
| **Customization:** Site owners, content owners, or editors can create agents tailored to specific needs. | **Content limitations:** As with all agents, if the agent can't find information in its defined knowledge sources, it might provide outdated content from the internet. |
| **Defined sources:** Agents draw on context from specific SharePoint sites and document libraries. | **Scalability:** Not suitable for large-scale or highly complex applications.  |
| **Ease of access:** Integrated directly into SharePoint, making it easy for users to access and interact with the agents.  | **Functionality and visibility limitations (SharePoint):** Declarative agents built in SharePoint can't integrate with or use declarative agents not build in SharePoint in Copilot Chat. |
| **Personalized user experience:** Provides a personalized user experience based on the specific SharePoint content.  | **Functionality and visibility limitations (Teams):** Chatting with agent in Teams 1:1 is done in immersive viewer from SharePoint. |
| **Integration with SharePoint:**  Uses existing SharePoint features like document libraries. | |
| **Integration with Teams:**  Users can make a SharePoint agent available in Microsoft Teams by copying the link to the agent and pasting it in a Teams group or meeting chat. |  |
