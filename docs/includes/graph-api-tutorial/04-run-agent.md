1. Open a command prompt and go to the folder where the repository is.
2. Type the following command: `jupyter notebook`. This opens a web page that contains all your scripts.
3. To make sure your LangChain setup is working, start with a simple agent:
    1. Select the firstAgent script. It will open in a separate page.
    2. Choose the **run** icon.
    3. You should see the following output on the line below.

Congratulations! You have successfully created your first agent. You can change characters and text input fields and run the script to see what your agent does.

If you run into errors that modules aren't available, you can install those Python packages from inside Jupyter Notebook. Go to a new line and type:

`%pip install {package-name}`

The script does the following:

- Sets the variables from the .env file.
- Uses the gpt-4o-mini model.
- Asks the agent to act like a character from Star Wars.

The `Hello! What are you up to?` text is the user query that is passed to the agent.

The `*Roooaaarrr!......` text is the output generated by the agent.
