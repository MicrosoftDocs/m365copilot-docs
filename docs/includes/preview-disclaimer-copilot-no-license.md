> - Custom engine agents are specialized chat experiences that can be built on any LLM, toolchain, or orchestration tool tailored to the domain or tenant workflows. They don't require a Microsoft 365 Copilot license to build, debug and deploy. However, custom engine agents are only available to licensed Microsoft 365 Copilot users or users in tenants that allow metered usage of agents.
> - The cost of a custom engine agent depends on the Azure services consumed in the app. To estimate the cost, visit the [Azure Pricing Calculator](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/calculator/).
