# Use the Scrum Assistant template to build an agent

You can use the Scrum Assistant template to create agents that support scrum masters and Agile teams by providing real-time guidance on scrum ceremonies, backlog management, and Agile best practices. Agents based on this template apply trusted scrum resources, analyze team artifacts (sprint reports, retrospective notes), and offer data-driven recommendations to enhance team performance, collaboration, and operational efficiency.

## Prerequisites

## Capabilities

Scrum Assistants support multiple languages and can:

- Provide real-time guidance on scrum ceremonies, backlog management, and best practices for Agile development.
- Use trusted scrum resources and team artifacts to offer data-driven recommendations.
- Help teams improve performance, collaboration, and efficiency.

## Use cases

Scrum Assistant agents are useful in the following scenarios.

| **Scenario** | **Description** |
| -----------  | -----------  |
| Improve operational efficiency | Helps reduce inefficiencies and support continuous improvement with suggestions for streamlining scrum ceremonies and improving sprint execution. |
| Boost productivity   | Fetches relevant scrum insights automatically to enable teams to focus on their deliverables. |

## Extension opportunities

You can enhance the functionality of your Scrum Assistant agents by:

- **Referencing company-specific Agile practices:** Connect a SharePoint site or files that contain company-specific Agile practices that are stored internally to align guidance with your organizational standards.
- **Linking with your learning materials:** Use Microsoft 365 Copilot connectors or APIs to index data about your team's Azure DevOps work items. This way, you can allow your Scrum Assistant to provide more contextual advice and guidance.
